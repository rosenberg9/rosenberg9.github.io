    - title: Undergraduate Thesis I: The Impacts of AGN Feedback on Galaxy Clusters
      institution: Department of Astronomy, University of Toronto, Canada
      year: 2024 - 2025
      description:
        - Research assistant for Professor Renée Hložek and Dr. Martine Lokken.
        - Ran hydrodynamic simulations with the 300 collaboration of galaxy clusters to understand how galactic
feedback affects large-scale structure.
        - Built packages to compare the pressure, density, temperature distributions and filament morphology across simulations.
        - Conducted a literature review and presented findings to colleagues internationally.
        - Work will likely be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This project was completed as part of a bachelor’s
thesis.

      description:
        - Research assistant for Professor Maya Fishbach.
        - Explored methods of recovering the redshift-distance relation from simulated gravitational-wave catalogs of
redshifted masses and distances.
        - Developed methods of recovering the Hubble constant from gravitational waves, applicable to real events.
        - Received Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship to continue this project over summer 2025.
        - Work will likely be published in a peer-reviewed journal. This project was completed as part of a second bachelor’s thesis, by special request.
