Since my third year at the University of Toronto, I have been a teaching assistant for several courses in the Departments of Mathematics and Astronomy. These include [Calculus I (MAT186)](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat186h1), [Calculus II (MAT187)](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat187h1), [Linear Algebra (MAT188)](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat188h1), and [Life on Other Worlds (AST251)](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ast251h1). 

In MAT187, I led three tutorials each week, guiding students through core concepts in calculus while reinforcing problem-solving techniques. Across all courses, my responsibilities included running tutorials, grading assignments, invigilating exams, and holding office hours. In total, I've worked with over 4,000 students, helping them navigate challenging topics in mathematics and astronomy.

Through these roles, I developed a deeper understanding of subjects I once took for granted. Teaching has given me the chance to witness studentsâ€™ moments of insight and curiosity firsthand. It reminded me of how my own interest in mathematics, physics, and cosmology was shaped by teachers who believed in me and showed real enthusiasm for the material. One day, I hope to pass on that same excitement to my own students.
