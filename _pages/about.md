I am an incoming master's student, but I still have not decided where :). I recently completed my Bachelor's at the University of Toronto, studying physics and astrophysics with a focus on cosmology, gravitational waves, and large-scale structure. Some of my past work has been on hydrodynamic simulations, gravitational waves, and particle physics.

I’m currently a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA), where I’m working on gravitational-wave spectral sirens.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a PhD in astrophysics, with continued focus on cosmology and numerical simulations. I'm also interested in teaching and mentorship and have served as a teaching assistant for several mathematics and astronomy courses. Outside of research, I like playing guitar, watching baseball, and hiking.
