I am a master's student in the <a href="https://www.master-mass.eu/">Erasmus MASS program</a>. It is a two year joint masters, offered by four universities across Europe. I am currently based in Rome, but am moving to study at the University of Belgrade in March.

I recently completed my Bachelor's at the University of Toronto, studying physics and astrophysics with a focus on cosmology, gravitational waves, and large-scale structure. Some of my past work has been on hydrodynamic simulations, gravitational waves, and particle physics.

Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a PhD in astrophysics, with continued focus on the intersection of cosmology and machine learning. I'm also interested in teaching and mentorship and have served as a teaching assistant for several mathematics and astronomy courses. Outside of research, I like playing guitar, watching baseball, and hiking.
